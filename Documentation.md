# Documentation

Welcome to Splita doc., although we are working to creating a really simple and user-friendly platform, here is a short guide to help you through the editing process

# Our Solution

Splita has been created to help solve the problem of handling large files which includes memory challenges and longer loading time. In the immediate, our platform is targeted for splitting large CSV and JSON file formats, with a view to adding more file formats and data manipulation features in the nearest future.
Our solution includes chunking large CSV and JSON files within minutes into smaller units of the same format. We are also providing the ability to download the chunked files immediately or save to the cloud it for future download. You donâ€™t need to have the file you want to process stored on your device. If you have a Google Drive or Dropbox account, you can download them straight to our page.

Splita is powered by Django framework, HTML, CSS, Javascript and MYSQL

To fully enjoy the rich service of this platform users need to authenticated via the Sign Up page or Login page from where they are transferred to the dashboard to do the chunking of the files. Unauthenticated users however cn only from the landing page view the documentation of our service.

# Technical Issues

Splita has been designed to be user-friendly and we have tried to tackle any technical issue. However, if you ever face any problem, do not hesitate to reach out. We will do our very best to come up with a solution.
